Warning: please never modify this document. Just fill it with the values required, then save it and run the program.(float number should be divided by '.')

Epsilon: is the stochastic modulation and should be a float digit in range [0.3, 1] 
Gamma  : is the attrito and should be a float digit in range (0, 0.5]
N.     : is the number of particles on which to perform the MonteCarlo simulation and should be an int > 1000 
Alfa.  : is to define the potential of the form V = (x^2 - Alfa*x)(x^2 + Beta*x)  
Beta.  : is to define the potential of the form V = (x^2 - Alfa*x)(x^2 + Beta*x)
Seed.  :



Epsilon = 0.4
Gamma.  = 0.1
N       = 1000
