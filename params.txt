#Epsilon: is the stochastic modulation and should be a float digit in range [0.3, 1] 
#Gamma  : is the attrito and should be a float digit in range (0, 0.5]
#N.     : is the number of particles on which to perform the MonteCarlo simulation and should be an int > 1000 
#Alfa.  : is to define the potential of the form V = (x^2 - Alfa*x)(x^2 + Beta*x) and should be >0  
#Beta.  : is to define the potential of the form V = (x^2 - Alfa*x)(x^2 + Beta*x) and should be >0
#Seed.  : is the seed of the Gaussian Random Number Generator
